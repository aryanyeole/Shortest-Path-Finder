This program finds the shortest path in a maze using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. The maze is visualized in the terminal using the curses library. The starting point of the maze is marked as O, and the endpoint is marked as X. The program highlights the path from the start to the end.

Features:
1. Implements BFS to find the shortest path.
2. Uses a queue to traverse the maze layer by layer.
3. Visually displays the maze and highlights the path in real-time using the curses library.
